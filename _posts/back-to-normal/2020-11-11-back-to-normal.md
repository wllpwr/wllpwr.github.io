About time.

Moving to Github pages was a test of my sanity. Not only did I have to learn how to use Jekyll, but using Markdown instead of Wordpress' fancy editor did a number on my past articles. 

In the end, I still don't know how to use Jekyll properly. My knowledge of HTML and CSS helped some. I did so much theme hopping that my downloads folder is chock-full of different git repos. The only reason why I switched is because I wanted finer control over the theme I'm using. Don't need to pay for anything for a simple dark mode theme. 

After days of searching, I finally settled on something that looks unique, and more importantly, *good*. And the best part is it doesn't make your eyes bleed (unless you want it to with the dark mode toggle).

Hopefully I find more encouragement to write about my recent technological endeavours.
